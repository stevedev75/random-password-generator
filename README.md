# Password Generator

## Application to generate a random password that meets certain user-selected criteria.

My motivation for this project was to create a web application that uses JavaScript (which was added to some HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript “starter” code provided by Trilogy) that would generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters meeting 
certain user-selected criteria (a potential combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special 
characters. 

I built this project, in part, to showcase my understanding of JavaScript and how it interfaces with the web browser.

This application solves the problem often found when a user needs to utilize a strong password for security purposes as Internet 
security has become increasingly important and with it the need for exceedingly strong passwords.

In this project, I learned a tremendous amount of information about JavaScript, specifically regarding if statements, while loops, 
window alerts and prompts, variables, and functions.
